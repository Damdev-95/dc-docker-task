This Dockerfile will generate the docker image which contains the static webpage. Somewhere in this webpage there are two hidden secret words.

The goal is to find the secret words by building/fixing/debugging this simple application and send them to the HR.

The app is written in GO language, however to accomplish this task it's not required to know anything about this programming language.

Good luck!
